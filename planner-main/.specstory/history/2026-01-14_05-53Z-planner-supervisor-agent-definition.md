Task for planner agent
3) Planner/Supervisor Agent (Orchestrator)
Purpose: Break a big goal into steps and coordinate other agents.
Inputs: a goal (“reduce CI failures”, “fix flaky tests”), constraints, current state.
Output: step plan + which agent/tool runs each step + checkpoints.
Safety rule: planning is not execution.
Usually runs: Backend/Core (because it may need a wider view and longer workflows).

**Reassessing directory listing approach**

The current listing shows no children, possibly due to permissions, hidden files, or filtering; I'll try listing with no ignore flags and also consider using glob patterns to verify file presence.</details></think>
